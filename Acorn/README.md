# Acorn

`Acorn` is a loose Java implementation of the JavaScript parser `Acorn`.
`Acorn` contains three "subpackages"

- `Acorn.Pestle` is the tokenizer package
- `Acorn.Stove` is the parser package
- `Acorn.Squirrel` is what evaluates the resulting abstract syntax tree

`AcornError` is just a class that does general errors within the `Acorn` packages
